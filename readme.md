## Ambiance Data

This repository is used to surface a weekly report which combines data from a (database that records the ambient characteristics of my bedroom)[https://snyderjo.github.io/ambience/], and (eventaully) the quality of my sleep as recoded by a wearable device.

The plan is to have this run weekly displaying data from three weeks ago.
